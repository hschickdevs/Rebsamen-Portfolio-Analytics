## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to create a web dashboard that will allow students and faculty to analyze portfolio performance, holdings breakdown, algorithmic trade recommendations, and fundamental & technical stock metrics for the University of Arkansas Rebsamen Trust, managed by the undergraduate invite-only Portfolio Management I and II class at the Sam M. Walton College of Business.

## Project Stack:

This project was built using the Streamlit Python framework. The backend has been specifically designed using Python to process the holdings excel file format as generated directly from the Stephens account.
