# Valuation Notes:
- Calculate target price by weighted valuations (numbered by priority)
    * (#1) ENTERPRISE VALUE / EBIDTA 50% weight:
      * AKA Enterprise multiple, also known as the EV-to-EBITDA multiple, is a ratio used to determine the value of a company.
      * It is computed by dividing enterprise value by EBITDA.
      * The enterprise multiple takes into account a company's debt and cash levels in addition to its stock price and relates that value to the firm's cash profitability. Enterprise multiples can vary depending on the industry.
      * Higher enterprise multiples are expected in high-growth industries and lower multiples in industries with slow growth
